I'm excited to announce that I've been selected to mentor a team of three computer science undergraduate students on their very first research project as part of the [Early Undergraduate Research Experience Program (EREP)](https://uwaterloo.ca/women-in-computer-science/programs-events/early-undergraduate-research-experience-program-erepur2phd/call-undergraduate-students) at the University of Waterloo.
