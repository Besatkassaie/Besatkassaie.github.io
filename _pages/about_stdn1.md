I am a postdoctoral researcher, supervised by Prof. [Renée Miller](https://rjmillerlab.github.io/), and a member of the Data Systems Group at the University of Waterloo. 

My research interests primarily focus on data systems.  I am particularly interested in challenges related to data intelligence, information extraction, unstructured data quality, and information retrieval.

I hold a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Waterloo, where my thesis, supervised by Prof. [Frank Tompa](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~fwtompa),  introduced and addressed the problem of [updatability in document databases](https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/items/7bc2cdeb-5dec-4303-a15c-6c1c4d37c9ed).
