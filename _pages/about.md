I am a postdoctoral researcher, supervised by Prof. Ren√©e Miller, and a member of the Data Systems Group at the University of Waterloo. My research interests primarily focus on data systems.  I am particularly interested in challenges related to data intelligence, information extraction, unstructured data quality, and information retrieval.

I hold a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Waterloo, where my thesis, supervised by Prof. Frank Tompa,  introduced and addressed the problem of updatability in document databases.
